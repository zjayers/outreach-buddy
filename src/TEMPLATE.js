Hello ${d.contactName}!

Hope this email finds you well.

I recently came across the job posting for the ${d.jobTitle} and am very excited about the prospect of exploring this opportunity further. As a full-stack software developer, I enjoy learning new technologies up and down the stack with expertise in ${d.keywords}.

Are you in charge of recruiting for this role? If so, would you be open to a conversation this week or early next to discuss the position, company culture, and how my background could be a fit? Thank you for your time.

Best,
`;

const rebuttal = (d) => {

Hello ${d.contactName},

Thanks for getting back to me. ${d.companyName} is absolutely where I'd like to end up. Perhaps my resume doesn't properly represent my technical skill level or programming knowledge. I'd be grateful for the opportunity to complete a coding challenge to demonstrate my skill set. This way you can assess my code and evaluate if it is at the level you need for the position. Can we set that up?

Either way, I'd love to connect on the phone to discuss potential future opportunities. Are you available at some point early next week?

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Best regards,
